Inventory management system for EnVibe, Inc

This is an inventory management system that logs data to google sheets. It is used by EnVibe, Inc to keep track of instruments. The code in this repository is for reference by anyone who wants to learn python or make a project with similar features.

This repository also includes various testing files that I used.

The code will not work on its own. It needs some extra resources to work, such as Google sheets information and audio and image files. Again, this repository is mostly for reference.
